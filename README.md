# javascript-drum-kit

Javascript drum kit is a project given by The Odin Project. The aim is to create a website that features the parts of a drum (kick,snare, etc.) and have them be playable using keyboard keys. Another aim is to have a simple GUI that displays a ring around the part of the drum being played.
